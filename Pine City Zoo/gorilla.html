                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are the largest primates on Earth and share about 98% of their DNA with humans, making them one of our closest
                living relatives. Native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas are divided into two main species: the
                eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, each with subspecies. They are known for their strength, intelligence, and
                gentle nature, especially when undisturbed in their natural habitat.</p>
                <p>Gorillas live in groups called troops or bands, led by a dominant male known as a silverback due to the distinctive
                silver hair on his back. The silverback is responsible for protecting the group and leading them to feeding sites.
                Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo shoots. They communicate using a variety
                of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions, which help maintain strong social bonds within the group.</p>
                <p>Despite their strength and size, gorillas are peaceful and shy by nature. Unfortunately, they face serious threats from
                habitat destruction, poaching, and diseases like Ebola. Mountain gorillas, in particular, are critically endangered, but
                conservation efforts—such as eco-tourism, anti-poaching patrols, and habitat preservation—have led to a slow increase in
                their population. Continued global attention and support are essential to ensure their long-term survival.</p>
