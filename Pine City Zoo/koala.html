                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, best known for their fluffy ears, large noses, and tree-dwelling lifestyle.
                Often mistakenly called "koala bears," they are not bears at all but are more closely related to wombats and kangaroos.
                Koalas spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees, where they eat the leaves almost exclusively. Their specialized
                digestive systems allow them to process the toxic compounds found in eucalyptus, which would be harmful to most other
                animals.</p>
                <p>Koalas are solitary creatures and have a slow, sedentary lifestyle, sleeping up to 18–22 hours a day to conserve energy
                due to their low-nutrient diet. Each koala occupies its own home range and communicates through loud bellows, especially
                during mating season. Baby koalas, called joeys, are born underdeveloped and continue to grow in their mother's pouch
                for about six months before gradually venturing out.</p>
                <p>Sadly, koalas are facing major threats due to habitat destruction, bushfires, disease (particularly chlamydia), and
                climate change. Their populations have declined significantly in many regions of Australia, prompting conservationists
                to push for stronger protections and habitat restoration. Koalas are not just iconic Australian animals—they also serve
                as indicators of healthy forest ecosystems, making their protection important for broader environmental conservation.</p>
