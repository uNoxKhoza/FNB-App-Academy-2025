                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their powerful build, striking orange coat with black
                stripes, and piercing eyes. Native to parts of Asia, tigers are solitary and territorial predators that rely on stealth
                and strength to hunt. There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal, Siberian, Sumatran, and Malayan
                tigers, each adapted to its specific environment, from tropical forests to snowy taigas.</p>
                <p>Unlike lions, tigers are solitary animals and usually hunt alone, often at night. They prey on a variety of animals such
                as deer, wild boar, and even larger prey like buffalo. Tigers are excellent swimmers and often cool off in lakes or
                riversâ€”an unusual trait among big cats. Each tiger's stripe pattern is unique, much like a human fingerprint, and helps
                with camouflage in their natural surroundings.</p>
                <p>Sadly, all tiger subspecies are either endangered or critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching for their body
                parts, and human conflict. The global population of wild tigers has declined drastically over the past century.
                Conservation efforts include anti-poaching patrols, habitat protection, and breeding programs in captivity.
                International awareness campaigns have also played a key role in protecting tigers, which are not only top predators but
                also vital to maintaining the ecological balance in the ecosystems they inhabit.</p>
