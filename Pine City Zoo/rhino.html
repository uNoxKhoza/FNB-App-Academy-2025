                <h3>RHINO</h3>
                <p>Rhinos, or rhinoceroses, are large, thick-skinned herbivores known for their impressive horns and prehistoric
                appearance. There are five species of rhino: the white and black rhinos found in Africa, and the Indian, Javan, and
                Sumatran rhinos found in Asia. Despite their size and strength, rhinos are generally peaceful grazers and browsers,
                feeding on grasses, leaves, and shrubs. They have poor eyesight but excellent hearing and a keen sense of smell, which
                helps them detect predators and other animals nearby.</p>
                <p>Each species of rhino has unique characteristics. For example, the white rhino is the largest and has a wide mouth
                adapted for grazing, while the black rhino has a pointed lip for browsing on shrubs. Asian rhinos tend to have one horn,
                while African species have two. Rhinos are mostly solitary, except for mothers with calves and occasional groupings at
                water holes. They often wallow in mud to cool down and protect their skin from insects and the sun.</p>
                <p>Sadly, rhinos are critically endangered, mainly due to poaching driven by demand for their horns, which are falsely
                believed to have medicinal properties in some cultures. Habitat loss and human conflict also contribute to their
                decline. Conservation efforts around the world include anti-poaching patrols, protected reserves, and translocation
                programs to help stabilize populations. Rhinos are a symbol of wildlife conservation, representing the urgent need to
                protect Earth's endangered species.
