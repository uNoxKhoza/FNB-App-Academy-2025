                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>Pandas, especially the giant panda, are beloved symbols of wildlife conservation and are native to the mountainous
                forests of central China. Recognizable by their distinctive black-and-white fur, giant pandas are a type of bear with a
                diet that consists mostly of bamboo. Despite having the digestive system of a carnivore, they have adapted to survive
                almost entirely on bamboo, consuming up to 40 pounds of it daily. Their powerful jaws and molar teeth are well-suited
                for crushing tough bamboo stalks.</p>
                <p>Pandas are generally solitary animals, with each adult maintaining its own territory. They communicate through
                vocalizations and scent markings and are most active during dawn and dusk. Female pandas are fertile only for a few days
                each year, making reproduction a challenge both in the wild and in captivity. Newborn pandas are tiny, blind, and pink,
                weighing about the same as a cup of tea, and depend entirely on their mothers for care and protection.</p>
                <p>Once listed as endangered due to habitat loss and low birth rates, giant pandas have made a remarkable comeback thanks
                to focused conservation efforts. China has established dozens of panda reserves and implemented bamboo forest
                restoration projects. As a result, the IUCN downgraded the giant panda's status from "endangered" to "vulnerable" in
                2016. Still, continued habitat protection and international cooperation are crucial to ensure the long-term survival of
                these gentle and iconic animals.</p>
