                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>Lions are powerful and majestic big cats known as the "kings of the jungle," although they typically inhabit grasslands
                and savannas rather than dense forests. Native to Africa and a small region in India (the Gir Forest), lions are the
                only truly social cats, living in groups called prides. A pride usually consists of related females, their cubs, and a
                few adult males. This social structure allows them to work together for hunting and protection.</p>
                <p>Male lions are easily recognized by their impressive manes, which vary in color and size and serve as a sign of strength
                and maturity. While females do most of the hunting—often in coordinated groups—males protect the pride's territory from
                rival lions and predators. Lions primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo, using
                stealth, teamwork, and bursts of speed to capture their food.</p>
                <p>Despite their strength, lions face significant threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Their
                populations have declined sharply over the past century, especially outside protected areas. Conservation efforts across
                Africa and in India focus on habitat preservation, reducing conflicts with local communities, and anti-poaching
                measures. Lions play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems, and their survival is vital for the health
                of the environments they inhabit.</p>
