                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The giraffe is the tallest land animal on Earth, known for its exceptionally long neck and legs. Native to various
                regions of Africa, giraffes are well adapted to savannas and open woodlands where they browse on leaves, particularly
                from acacia trees. Their long necks, which can be up to six feet in length, allow them to reach foliage that few other
                herbivores can access. Despite having the same number of neck vertebrae as humans (seven), each vertebra in a giraffe is
                greatly elongated.</p>
                <p>Giraffes live in loose social groups, often called towers, which typically consist of females and their young. Males
                tend to roam more independently or join temporary bachelor herds. They are generally peaceful animals, but males may
                engage in "necking" battles, where they swing their necks and heads at each other to establish dominance. Giraffes
                communicate using a range of sounds, body movements, and even infrasoundâ€”vibrations too low for humans to hear.</p>
                <p>These gentle giants are listed as vulnerable or endangered in some regions due to habitat loss, poaching, and human
                encroachment. Conservation programs are working to protect giraffe habitats and promote breeding initiatives. As iconic
                symbols of African wildlife, giraffes attract tourists and researchers alike, playing a key role in raising awareness
                about the importance of preserving biodiversity on the continent.</p>
