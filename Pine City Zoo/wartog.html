                <h3>WARTOG</h3>
                <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found across the grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan
                Africa. They are easily recognized by their large, curved tusks, flat snouts, and distinctive facial "warts," which are
                actually thick pads that protect their faces during fights. Despite their rugged appearance, warthogs are surprisingly
                fast and agile, capable of running at high speeds to escape predators like lions, cheetahs, and hyenas.</p>
                <p>Warthogs are primarily grazers and rooters, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and bark. They use their strong snouts
                and tusks to dig for food, especially during dry seasons when grass is scarce. Warthogs often kneel on their front knees
                while grazing, thanks to special calloused pads that protect their legs. They are also known to use abandoned burrows
                made by other animals, such as aardvarks, for shelter and protection—often backing in to face outward and defend
                themselves if needed.</p>
                <p>Though they may appear aggressive, warthogs are generally shy and will flee danger rather than fight. However, they are
                capable of defending themselves with their sharp tusks when cornered. Warthogs play an important role in the ecosystem
                by helping to aerate soil and spread seeds. They are a common sight on African safaris and have gained popularity in
                global culture through media and conservation efforts, reminding people of Africa’s rich and diverse wildlife.</p>
