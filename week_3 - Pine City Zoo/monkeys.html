                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent and social primates found in a wide range of habitats, from tropical rainforests and savannas to mountainous regions and urban areas. They are generally divided into two major groups: New World monkeys, which live in Central and South America, and Old World monkeys, found in Africa and Asia. These groups differ in features like nose shape, tail function, and body size. Many monkeys are agile climbers, using their limbs and sometimes prehensile tails to navigate trees.</p>
                <p>Monkeys live in complex social groups and display a wide range of behaviors, including grooming, play, vocal
                communication, and tool use. Their diets vary depending on the species but often include fruits, leaves, insects, and
                small animals. Some monkeys, such as capuchins and macaques, are known for their problem-solving skills and ability to
                adapt to human environments. They communicate with each other through facial expressions, sounds, and body language,
                showing emotions such as affection, fear, and aggression.</p>
                <p>While monkeys are fascinating and often beloved animals, many species are threatened by habitat destruction, hunting,
                and the illegal pet trade. Deforestation and human expansion continue to shrink their natural environments, pushing some
                species to the brink of extinction. Conservation programs aim to protect monkey habitats, raise awareness, and
                rehabilitate rescued individuals. Monkeys play essential roles in their ecosystems, such as spreading seeds, making
                their conservation important for maintaining biodiversity.</p>
